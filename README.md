# Architecture Overview (MVVM)
- The app follows the MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) design pattern, ensuring a clean separation of concerns:

- Model: Represents the chat message and user data fetched from Firestore.
- View: The Flutter UI screens, including chat rooms, login, and registration views.
- ViewModel: Interacts with Firebase and Firestore, manages state with Provider, and exposes data to the views.
- Firestore Structure
- The Firestore database is organized as follows:

# Users Collection:
- Fields: username, email.
- ChatRooms Collection:
- Each document represents a chat room.
- Fields: roomName, createdBy, timestamp, etc.
- Subcollection: Messages
- Fields: messageText, sentBy, timestamp, etc.
